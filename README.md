# Quotes

TODO:
 * -refactor backend/gateway classes - some code can probably be reused-
 * fix quotes that have a 'FLAG' tag
 * -don't use an absolute path for db url- now using mysql
  ** -db url for production?-
 * find a better way to require files
 * -change quote#id > quote#uid-
 * -build book aggregate-
 * -turn kindle imporing task into a usecase- it's a task
 * tasks should be run through a higher level domain (manager::interface?)
 * how to handle deleted quotes/publications?  can they be deleted?  what if other users have marked them as favorites?
